# Heart Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to detect heart disease using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to analyze a dataset containing various health metrics and build a model that can predict the presence of heart disease.

## Directory Structure


- `heart_disease_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `modified_expanded_heart_disease.csv`: Dataset used for training and evaluating the machine learning models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ml_project
    ```


### Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook heart_disease_classification.ipynb
    ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the data analysis and machine learning code.

## Dataset

The dataset `modified_expanded_heart_disease.csv` contains various features related to heart disease. Each row represents a patient, and each column represents a different health metric or attribute.

## Project Details

### Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Encoding categorical variables

### Model Training

- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
- Training various machine learning models
- Evaluating model performance

### Results

The results of the model evaluations, including accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics, are documented in the Jupyter notebook.
